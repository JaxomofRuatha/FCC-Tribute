    <h3 class="text-left">This is a timeline of Dr. Chomsky's life:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>1928</b> - Born in Philadelphia, PA.</li>
          <li><b>1945</b> - Begins attending the University of Pennsylvania, studying philosophy, logic, and languages, especially Arabic.</li>
          <li><b>1947</b> - Meets Zellig Harris, who introduces Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinces him to major in the subject.</li>
          <li><b>1949</b> - Marries Carol Doris Schatz, a friend since childhood, and was made a Fellow at Harvard.</li>
          <li><b>1955</b> - Secures a position as assistant professor at MIT, splitting time between teaching linguistics and philosophy and working on a project involving mechanical translation.</li>
      <li><b>1958</b> - Publishes <i>Syntactic Structures</i>, his first book on linguistics. This is recognized by many as a cornerstone work in developing the scientific study of language.</li>
          <li><b>1967</b> - Publishes an essay titled "The Responsibility of Intellectuals" criticizing the Vietnam War, of which he was an ardent opponent.</li>

          <li><b>1980</b> - Chomsky defended the right of Robert Faurisson to advocate Holocaust denial as a part of freedom of speech, and was again condemned as supporting the views of the defendant rather than his rights.</li>
